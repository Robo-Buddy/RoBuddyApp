Hello Future Robuddy Team

This is a readme specifically from the person that worked on the application beforehand.  I'll lay out what improvements need to be made and how things currently work

For most activities, check out the top of the page, I added a small blurb on what they are supposed to do and how I suggest improving/fixing them.  For the most part,
the app is in fact functional, but there are still some bugs I find every once in a while, such as some funny crashes.  Furthermore, the biggest failure on my part was
the inability to get a working "Worker Application" to pair with the user application that is made for you here.  Effectively, the worker should be notified when someone
checks out an item, and the worker should be able to approve of the transaction.  Furthermore, I have not implemented this on the user application yet, but users should be 
able to return their items to the LMS, and the worker should be able to confirm that the item has been turned in.  

Lastly, I apologize in advance if some of the stylistic choices in the code are not the greatest, Android development has been a bit of a search online until I can figure
out what is happening process.  I thank you in advance if you guys can fix some of my sillier mistakes if you find them.

Best of luck!
